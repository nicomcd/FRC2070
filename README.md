# First Robotics Competition 2020

> This is meant to store our code from the year 2020 for the First Robotics Competition (FRC) in 2020. During this time, our team, 2070, had just begun using Java as a means of programming rather than using LabVIEW in previous years. The day of the first competition of the season, it was annouced that it would be canceled due to COVID-19. Our team had diligently worked to complete a fully functional robot and did not have the opportunity to compete because of these external circumstances.
